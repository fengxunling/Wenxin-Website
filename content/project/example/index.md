# Introduction
The study of cognitive tasks plays a crucial role in understanding human mental processes. Recently, recurrent neural networks have been widely applied in the computational modelling of cognition, offering a controllable approach to investigating cognitive processes and the relationship between cognitive tasks. However, current research primarily focuses on specific tasks, ignoring the fact that real brains have knowledge of multiple tasks simultaneously in different brain regions.
